                The <strong>violin</strong>, colloquially known as a <strong>fiddle</strong>, is a wooden <em>chordophone</em>, and is the smallest, and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in regular use in the violin family. Smaller violin-type instruments exist, including the violino piccolo and the pochette, but these are virtually unused. Most violins have a hollow wooden body, and commonly have four strings (sometimes five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a bow across the strings. The violin can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).

                The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In <strong>Europe</strong>, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the <strong>viola</strong>.<br>
            
                The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an <em>archetier</em> or <em>bowmaker</em>.

            <p>
                The earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked (for example, the <strong>Greek lyre</strong>). Two-stringed, bowed instruments, played upright and strung and bowed with horsehair, may have originated in the nomadic <em>equestrian cultures</em> of <strong>Central Asia</strong>, in forms closely resembling the modern-day Mongolian Morin huur and the Kazakh Kobyz. Similar and variant types were probably disseminated along east–west trading routes from <strong>Asia</strong> into the <strong>Middle East</strong>, and the <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to <strong>Encyclopædia Britannica</strong>, the direct ancestor of all <strong>European</strong> bowed instruments is the <strong>Arabic</strong> <em>rebab</em>, which developed into the <strong>Byzantine</strong> <em>lyra</em> developed by the 9th century and later the <strong>European</strong> <em>rebec</em>. Several sources suggest alternative possibilities for the violin's origins, such as northern or western <strong>Europe</strong>. The first makers of violins probably borrowed from various developments of the <strong>Byzantine</strong> <em>lyra</em>. These included the <em>vielle</em> (also known as the <em>fidel</em> or <em>viuola</em>) and the <em>lira da braccio</em>. The violin in its present form emerged in early 16th-century northern <strong>Italy</strong>. The earliest pictures of violins, albeit with three strings, are seen in northern <strong>Italy</strong> around 1530, at around the same time as the words "<em>violino</em>" and "<em>vyollon</em>" are seen in <strong>Italian</strong> and <strong>French</strong> documents. One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, is from the <em>Epitome</em> musical by <strong>Jambe de Fer</strong>, published in <strong>Lyon</strong> in 1556. By this time, the violin had already begun to spread throughout <strong>Europe</strong>.<br>

                Significant changes occurred in the construction of the violin in the 18th century, particularly a longer neck which is angled more toward the back of the instrument than in earlier examples, heavier strings, and a heavier bass bar. The majority of old instruments have undergone these modifications, and hence are in a significantly different state than when they left the hands of their makers, doubtless with differences in sound and response. But it is in their present (modified) condition that these instruments have set the standard for perfection in violin craftsmanship and sound, and violin makers all over the world try to come as close to this ideal as possible.

The current record amount paid for a <strong>Stradivari</strong> violin is £9.8 million (US$15.9 million at that time), when the instrument known as the <strong>Lady Blunt</strong> was sold by <strong>Tarisio Auctions</strong> in an online auction on June 20, 2011.

            <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
            <p>
                The word "violin" was first used in <strong>English</strong> in the 1570s. The word "violin" comes from "<strong>Italian</strong> <em>violino</em>, diminutive of <em>viola</em>". The term "viola" comes from the expression for "tenor violin" in 1797, from <strong>Italian</strong> and Old <strong>Provençal</strong> <em>viola</em>, [which came from] Medieval Latin <em>vitula</em> as a term which means 'stringed instrument', perhaps [coming] from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy..., or from related Latin verb vitulari, "to cry out in joy or exaltation." The related term <strong>Viola da gamba</strong> meaning 'bass viol' (1724) is from <strong>Italian</strong>, literally "a viola for the leg" (i.e. to hold between the legs)."A violin is the "modern form of the smaller, medieval viola da braccio." ("arm viola")<br>

                The violin is often called a fiddle. "Fiddle" can be used as the instrument's customary name in folk music, or as an informal name for the instrument in other styles of music. The word "fiddle" was first used in English in the late 14th century. The word "fiddle" comes from "fedele, fydyll, fidel, earlier fithele, from Old <strong>English</strong> fiðele 'fiddle', which is related to Old <strong>Norse</strong> fiðla, <strong>Middle Dutch</strong> vedele, <strong>utch</strong>D vedel, <strong>Old High German</strong> fidula, <strong>German</strong> Fiedel, 'a fiddle'; all of uncertain origin." As to the origin of the word "fiddle", the "...usual suggestion, based on resemblance in sound and sense, is that it is from <strong>Medieval Latin vitula</strong>."
